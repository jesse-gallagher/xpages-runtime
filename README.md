# XPages Runtime

This project allows for running XPages applications outside of Domino. It has been specifically used in Open Liberty, but there's nothing in here tied to that container.

Since XPages does not inherently require OSGi, this project doesn't bother initializing an OSGi runtime (though some Eclipse dependencies are brought along for the ride).

## Building and Using

To build this project or use it as a dependency, you must have a property in your Maven ~/.m2/settings.xml named `notes-platform` and containing a URL to a Domino Update Site for Domino 12.0.2+. For example:

```xml
<profiles>
    <profile>
        <id>notes</id>
        <properties>
            <notes-platform>file:///Users/jesse/Java/Domino12.0.2</notes-platform>
        </properties>
    </profile>
</profile>
<activeProfiles>
    <activeProfile>notes</activeProfile>
</activeProfiles>
```

Such an update site can be built from a Notes or Domino installation using the [`generate-domino-update-site` Maven plugin](https://github.com/OpenNTF/generate-domino-update-site). This project expects an update site built with at least version 4.2.0 of `generate-domino-update-site`.

When using this runtime in your downstream project, that project should also include a repository reference for the Update Site accessed via the [`p2-layout-resolver` Maven plugin](https://github.com/OpenNTF/p2-layout-provider), configured with the ID `com.hcl.xsp.repo`.

## Running

The servlet container running the app must have access to a local Notes or Domino environment. On Windows, this is taken care of by the registry when installing the apps. On Linux or macOS, this can be accomplished by setting appropriate environment variables, such as by adding this to a `server.env` file in Open Liberty:

```
Notes_ExecDirectory=/Applications/IBM Notes.app/Contents/MacOS
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Applications/IBM Notes.app/Contents/MacOS
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Applications/IBM Notes.app/Contents/MacOS
```

Additionally, for all platforms, add a `jvm.options` file for the Open Liberty server:

```
-Djava.library.path=/Applications/IBM Notes.app/Contents/MacOS
-Dcom.ibm.commons.platform=org.openntf.xpages.runtime.domino.platform.JakartaDominoPlatform
```

Notes or Domino do not need to be running - indeed, it's probably best if they're not. To run on an active Domino server, use [the Domino Open Liberty Runtime project](https://github.com/OpenNTF/openliberty-domino).

## Web App Layout

Apps built using this runtime should be structured generally like a [normal web app](https://www.mkyong.com/maven/how-to-create-a-web-application-project-with-maven/), with some important notes about the translation from an NSF-based XPages application to a web app:

* Themes should go in `WEB-INF/themes`
* XPages should go in `WEB-INF/xpages` and can have a folder hierarchy
* Custom controls should go in `WEB-INF/controls`. `.xsp-config` files must be manually managed
* The faces-config file should be `WEB-INF/faces-config.xml`
* The XSP properties file should be `WEB-INF/xsp.properties`
* Unlike in an NSF, images, JavaScript, CSS, and other resources should all go in the content root (`src/main/webapp` in Maven layout) and have no inherent folder structure

## Development Mode

During app development, it is useful to set the `xsp.extlib.dvlp` property to `true` to get the same sort of "pick up on resource changes" behavior that you get with e.g. CSS files in an NSF. This property is reflected in `ExtLibUtil.isDevelopmentMode()` and is determined in [several potential ways](https://github.com/OpenNTF/XPagesExtensionLibrary/blob/25b3b1df7fafb7ceb131e07ade93de5c9ff733d5/extlib/lwp/product/runtime/eclipse/plugins/com.ibm.xsp.extlib.core/src/com/ibm/xsp/extlib/util/ExtLibUtil.java#L65):

- From your app's "xsp.properties" (which will be reflected during deployment as well)
- From the "properties/xsp.properties" file within your Notes/Domino data directory (esoteric and not recommended)
- From the "xsp/bootstrap.properties" file within your Notes/Domino installation (similar to above)
- As a Java system property
- As the `XPagesDev` notes.ini property

For development purposes, the system property is likely the most convenient. For example, in a Liberty server managed from Eclipse's "Servers" view, this can be set in the "bootstrap.properties" file.

## Limitations and Expectations

* On Open Liberty, the `jsp` and `jsf` features cannot be enabled. Enabiling either one of them will cause load-order problems and, in the latter case, `ClassCastException`s.
* There is no context database by default. If you wish to have a default `database` and `session*` variables, they'll have to be created and managed using a variable resolver or other mechanism.
* Similarly, it's best to avoid Domino-specific components in general, such as `xp:dominoDocument` and `xp:dominoView`. Though they can be made to work, it's asking for trouble.
* All extensions (such as `XspLibrary` implementations) must be declared using the `META-INF/services` method and not `plugin.xml`. An extension of type `com.ibm.commons.Extension` can be directly translated by taking the `type` and making a file of that name in the services directory, containing a list of newline-separated class names.
* Similarly, this runtime will not recognize servlets declared via the [Equinox servlet extension point](https://www.eclipse.org/equinox/server/http_in_equinox.php) and must be registered either using the `@WebServlet` annotation or in the app's web.xml.
* Any OSGi Activator classes will not be activated by default, and must instead be explicitly registered. This can be done by registering a service class to `org.openntf.xpages.runtime.osgi.ActivatorNameProvider` implementing the interface of the same name and returning a list of Activator classes to instantiate. These Activator classes are expected to have a public static property named `instance` that will be set to the created instance.
* Unlike an NSF-hosted XPages application, these apps are not running inside a `com.ibm.designer.runtime.domino.adapter.ComponentModule` and so not all normal capabilities are available.
* The XPages servlet is mapped to "*" to allow for URLs like `/foo.xsp/bar/baz`.

## XSP Transpiler

The runtime will automatically translate XSP source files to executable pages at runtime, but initial load performance can be improved with the use of the XSP Transpiler Maven Mojo. This can be configured by adding an execution to your project to transpile and one to add the generated source to the build path:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.openntf.xpages</groupId>
  <artifactId>xsp-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>2.2.0</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>transpile-xsp</id>
      <goals>
        <goal>transpile</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
  <artifactId>build-helper-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.7</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>add-source</id>
      <phase>generate-sources</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>add-source</goal>
      </goals>
      <configuration>
        <sources>
          <source>${project.build.directory}/generated-sources/java</source>
        </sources>
      </configuration>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```

This will search for XPages in the `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/xpages` directory and Custom Controls in the `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/controls` directory and output translated Java files to `${project.build.directory}/generated-sources/java`.

Note: since this takes place in the `generate-sources` phase by default, it will likely throw an exception if you have a Custom Control that has a property whose type is a class defined inside the current project.

To use this goal, your project must depend on the core `xpages-runtime` project, as this expects classes from the XPages stack to be present in your project's classpath.
